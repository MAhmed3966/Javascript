// Lexical scope defines how variable names are resolved in nested functions

// Nested (child) functions have access to the scope of their parent functions

// This is often confused with closure, but Lexical scope is only an 
// important part of closure


// Global scope
let x = 1 ;

const parentFunctions = () => {
    // local scope is
    let myValue = 1 ;
    console.log(x);
    console.log({myValue});
}
